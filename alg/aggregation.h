// Run with aggregation(#particles) on the simulator command line.
//
// Basic description:
// The initial state of the system is created by randomly distributing particles
// within a box. After this, the particles attempt to aggregate together by
// executing the following rules:
// 1) If there is a particle in sight, rotate in place (thus shifting the
// particle's center of rotation.
// 2) If there is no such particle in sight, move around the center of rotation,
// thus shifting the particle's position as well as the direction of its field
// of vision.
